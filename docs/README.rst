Overview
--------

The purpose of this document is to provide an architecture for a secure multi-cloud infrastructure as code framework. The scope of this document includes the different cloud providers and environments that will be used in the infrastructure, the security controls that will be implemented to protect the infrastructure, and the tools and technologies that will be used to manage the infrastructure as code.

The infrastructure as code framework aims to provide a consistent, automated, and secure way to manage the infrastructure across multiple cloud environments. By using infrastructure as code, it's possible to version control the infrastructure, automate the provisioning and configuration of resources, and ensure that the infrastructure is in compliance with security and regulatory requirements.

This document will cover the following topics:

- Cloud infrastructure
- Security controls
- Secrets management
- Infrastructure as code
- Continuous integration and delivery
- Monitoring and logging
- Compliance and regulatory requirements


Cloud Infrastructure
--------------------

The infrastructure as code framework will utilize multiple cloud providers to provide a secure, scalable, and highly available environment. The following common components will be utilized across all cloud providers:

- Compute: Virtual machines or instances will be used to run the applications.
- Storage: Object storage will be used to store and retrieve files, backups, and data archiving.
- Databases: Relational databases will be used to store application data.
- Load Balancing: Load balancing service will be used to distribute incoming web traffic across multiple instances.

Each cloud provider will have their own implementation of these components, for example, AWS offers EC2 for compute, S3 for storage, RDS for databases, and Elastic Load Balancing for load balancing. GCP offers Compute Engine for compute, Cloud Storage for storage, Cloud SQL for databases, and Cloud Load Balancing for load balancing.

In addition to these common components, other services such as serverless compute and container orchestration services may also be utilized as needed.

The private cloud will also be based on common components, which include Proxmox Virtualization Environment for compute, Ceph for storage and OpenStack for private cloud management.

Automation and Configuration Management
---------------------------------------

Terraform
^^^^^^^^^

Terraform is a tool for provisioning and managing infrastructure across multiple cloud providers. It uses a simple, human-readable language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to define infrastructure as code. Terraform can be used to manage resources such as virtual machines, networks, and storage.

SaltStack
^^^^^^^^^

SaltStack is a tool for configuration management. SaltStack uses a simple, human-readable language called YAML to define configuration as code. SaltStack can be used to manage the configuration of servers, including installing and configuring software, managing users and permissions, and more.

Github Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Github Actions is a tool that can be used to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the code. By using Github Actions, you can set up a pipeline that automatically triggers when changes are pushed to the repository, and then runs a series of tasks such as building, testing, and deploying the code.

Pipeline
^^^^^^^^

The pipeline for managing the infrastructure as code will consist of the following steps:

1. Developers push code changes to a branch in the repository
2. Github Actions is triggered and runs a Terraform plan to ensure that the infrastructure changes are valid
3. Github Actions runs a SaltStack formula to ensure that the configuration changes are valid
4. Terraform apply and SaltStack state.apply is run to apply the changes to the infrastructure
5. A final test is run to validate the changes
6. The code is deployed to production

This approach allows for an automated and efficient way to manage the cloud infrastructure and ensures that the code is always in a known good state, making it easy to rollback if something goes wrong.
