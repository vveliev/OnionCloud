Incident Response Procedures
============================

Introduction
------------

In the event of a security incident, it is crucial to have well-defined and tested procedures in place to respond quickly and effectively. Our incident response procedures are designed to minimize the impact of an incident on our infrastructure and customers, while also ensuring compliance with relevant regulations.

Incident Identification
-----------------------

The first step in incident response is to identify that an incident has occurred. This can be done through a variety of means, including:

- Monitoring: Our monitoring systems, such as Graylog and Zabbix, are configured to alert on security-related events.
- User reports: Customers or employees may report suspicious activity.
- Penetration testing: Our regular penetration testing exercises may uncover vulnerabilities.

Once an incident has been identified, it should be logged in a centralized incident management tool, such as Jira, for tracking and reporting.

Incident Response Team
----------------------

An incident response team (IRT) is responsible for managing the incident response process. The IRT should be composed of individuals from different departments and with different areas of expertise, such as security, operations, legal, and compliance.

The IRT should have clear roles and responsibilities, as well as a defined chain of command. Regular training and exercises should be conducted to ensure the team is prepared to respond to incidents.

Incident Triage
---------------

Once an incident has been identified and logged, the IRT should conduct a triage to assess the severity of the incident and determine the appropriate response. The triage should consider factors such as:

- Impact on customers and the business
- Compliance implications
- Potential for data loss or exfiltration
- Indicators of compromise

Based on the triage, the IRT should assign the incident to the appropriate team for further investigation and response.

Incident Investigation and Containment
--------------------------------------

The incident investigation and containment phase involves collecting evidence, identifying the root cause of the incident, and taking steps to contain the incident and prevent it from spreading.

During this phase, the incident should be contained as quickly as possible to prevent further damage. This may involve disconnecting compromised systems from the network, shutting down services, or implementing other mitigation measures.

Evidence should be collected and preserved for later analysis and reporting. This may include system logs, network captures, and memory dumps.

Incident Eradication and Recovery
----------------------------------

Once the incident has been contained, the focus should shift to eradicating the incident and restoring normal operations. This may involve:

- Removing malware or other malicious code from systems
- Patching vulnerabilities
- Changing credentials
- Conducting a forensic analysis to determine the scope and impact of the incident

Once the incident has been eradicated, the affected systems and services should be tested and brought back online.

Incident Lessons Learned
------------------------

The final phase of incident response is to document the incident, including what occurred, what actions were taken, and what could be improved.

A post-incident review should be conducted to identify any gaps or areas for improvement in the incident response process. This may include changes to policies, procedures, or technical controls.

The incident should also be reported to relevant stakeholders, such as customers, regulators, and law enforcement, as required.
