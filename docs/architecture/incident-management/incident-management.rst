Incident Response and Disaster Recovery Procedures
==================================================

Introduction
------------
In the event of an incident or disaster, it is crucial to have well-defined and tested procedures in place to minimize disruption to services and ensure the timely recovery of critical systems and data. This document outlines the incident response and disaster recovery procedures for our multicloud infrastructure design.

Incident Response
-----------------
In the event of an incident, the following procedures will be followed:

1. Identification: The incident will be identified and documented by the incident response team.
2. Containment: The incident response team will take immediate action to contain the incident and prevent further damage.
3. Eradication: The incident response team will work to eradicate the cause of the incident.
4. Recovery: The incident response team will work to restore normal service operations as quickly as possible.
5. Lessons Learned: The incident response team will document the incident and any lessons learned for future reference.

Disaster Recovery
-----------------
In the event of a disaster, the following procedures will be followed:

1. Activation: The disaster recovery plan will be activated by the incident response team.
2. Failover: Critical systems and data will be failed over to the disaster recovery site.
3. Recovery: The incident response team will work to restore normal service operations as quickly as possible.
4. Lessons Learned: The incident response team will document the disaster and any lessons learned for future reference.

Availability
-----------
Our design includes multiple data centers in different regions to ensure high availability of services. In addition, we use a combination of load balancers, redundancy and self-healing mechanisms to ensure that our services remain available even in the event of a failure.

SOC 2 Compliance
----------------
To meet SOC 2 compliance requirements, our design includes the following:
- Use of Active Directory or similar for user authentication and authorization.
- Use of Graylog for logging and monitoring.
- Use of GitHub for pull requests and branch protection for code changes.
- Use of Hashicorp Vault for secrets management with access policies,app credentials, PKI and key vault secret store kv2.
- Use of Jira for change management process
- Use of Github actions for automated validation

Incident Response and Disaster Recovery procedures are tested and reviewed regularly to ensure that they meet SOC 2 compliance requirements and also to meet the requirements of other certifications such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, ISO 27001, NIST 800-53 and GDPR.
