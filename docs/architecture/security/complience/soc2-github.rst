GitHub Integration
------------------

GitHub is a popular platform for managing source code and collaborating on software development projects. In addition to its code management capabilities, GitHub also provides a number of features that can be used to support compliance with SOC 2 requirements.

One key feature of GitHub is the ability to create pull requests. Pull requests can be used to review and approve changes to code, documentation, and other resources before they are merged into the main branch. This can be used to ensure that changes are reviewed and approved by the appropriate parties, and that any issues or concerns are addressed before the changes are implemented.

Another feature of GitHub that can be used to support compliance is branch protection. Branch protection allows you to set rules for who can make changes to specific branches, and can be used to ensure that only authorized users are able to make changes to sensitive resources.

Additionally, GitHub also provides access to a number of third-party integrations, such as JIRA and Active Directory, which can be used to provide additional security and compliance capabilities.

To integrate GitHub into your SOC 2 compliance design, you will need to consider the following steps:

1. Identify the resources that need to be protected and the access controls that need to be in place.

2. Create pull requests and branch protection rules to ensure that changes are reviewed and approved by the appropriate parties.

3. Use third-party integrations, such as JIRA and Active Directory, to provide additional security and compliance capabilities.

4. Regularly review and update your GitHub configuration to ensure that it continues to meet your compliance requirements.
