- Remote Access VPNs: These are used to allow individual users to securely connect to our cloud environment from remote locations. They provide a secure and convenient way for users to access resources in our cloud environment.

VPN Technologies

We use industry-standard VPN technologies such as IPsec, SSL, and L2TP to implement our VPNs. These technologies provide a high level of security and compatibility with a wide range of devices and platforms.

VPN Configuration and Management

Our VPNs are configured and managed using a combination of manual configuration and automation. We use tools such as Ansible and Terraform to automate the deployment and management of our VPNs, while also providing the ability to manually configure and troubleshoot our VPNs.
