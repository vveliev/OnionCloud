Network Segmentation
====================

Network segmentation is a critical component of our multi-cloud infrastructure, allowing us to isolate and secure the different segments of our network, while also providing scalability and flexibility.

IaaS for Private Networks and Customers
---------------------------------------

Our infrastructure is designed to provide IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) for both private networks and customers. This allows us to provide a high level of isolation and security for our customers, while also allowing them to take advantage of the scalability and flexibility of our infrastructure.

Hardware Layer and C2 Site Proxmox
----------------------------------

Our infrastructure also includes a hardware layer and C2 Site Proxmox that provide a high level of scalability and reliability for our network. The C2 Site Proxmox is responsible for managing the virtualization of our infrastructure, while the hardware layer provides the underlying physical resources.

Cumulus Linux
-------------

In addition to the above, we also use Cumulus Linux on our network switches. Cumulus Linux is an open-source network operating system that allows us to use standard networking hardware and run Linux-based network protocols on top of it. This allows us to take advantage of Linux-based automation and management tools for automating the deployment of network configurations and policies, as well as for monitoring and troubleshooting our network.
